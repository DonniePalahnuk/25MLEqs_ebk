# 25 Key Equations in Machine Learning

## Introduction

Welcome to the GitHub repository for **"25 Key Equations in Machine Learning"** by Donnie Palahnuk. This book is a deep dive into the foundational mathematical equations and the principles behind these equations which underpin modern data science and machine learning. Each chapter is dedicated to exploring a key equation, providing not only theoretical insights but also practical calculation and code based examples or basic implementations. This repository complements the book, providing all the example codes (in progress), references, and resources in a cohesive manner.

By breaking down these equations into digestible segments, our goal is to help learners—from aspiring data scientists to experienced engineers—gain a deeper understanding of how these core equations contribute to the field of machine learning.

In each chapter we provide a tie to machine learning. This is meant to leave the reader with solid understanding of the underlying equation and the key properties that are important for ML application and perhaps theoretically important properties which underpin the nature of the equation.

## What is NOT the Aim 
We are actaully not trying to create a ML/DL algorithm book. There are numerous books that have emerged taht do this to various levels of complexity. And as this is a quickly evolving field the aim here is not to show the 'newest' trick, but to show what are the most fundamental equations which for the base of the ML/DL pyramid. 

## Contents

This repository includes:

- **Source Code and Examples**: Python, R, and some instances of Mathematica codes to accompany the book's chapters.
- **Visualization Tools**: R code blocks with rendering
- **Practice Problems**: (TO FOLLOW) Exercises for each chapter designed to solidify your understanding, with answers available for self-assessment.
- **Supplemental Materials**: References, links to key academic papers, and additional resources to enhance your learning experience.

Key tenets of Insight Hatch include:
- **Inclusivity and Diversity**: We believe in the power of varied minds working towards a common goal.
