# 25 Key Equations in Machine Learning

## Introduction

Welcome to the GitHub repository for **"25 Key Equations in Machine Learning"** by Donald Walter Palahnuk, Jr. This book is a deep dive into the foundational mathematical principles that underpin modern data science and machine learning. Each chapter is dedicated to exploring a key equation, providing not only theoretical insights but also practical examples and implementations. This repository complements the book, providing all the example codes, references, and resources in a cohesive manner.

This journey explores key topics such as optimization algorithms, statistical measures, activation functions, clustering algorithms, and much more. By breaking down these equations into digestible segments, our goal is to help learners—from aspiring data scientists to experienced engineers—gain a deeper understanding of how these core concepts contribute to the field of machine learning.

## Contents

This repository includes:

- **Source Code and Examples**: Python, R, and some instances of Mathematica codes to accompany the book's chapters.
- **Visualization Tools**: Jupyter notebooks and visualization scripts to illustrate concepts like Gradient Descent, Z-Score, Normal Distribution, and others.
- **Practice Problems**: Exercises for each chapter designed to solidify your understanding, with answers available for self-assessment.
- **Supplemental Materials**: References, links to key academic papers, and additional resources to enhance your learning experience.

## Insight Hatch Initiative

The **Insight Hatch** initiative is the think tank and open research collective that inspired this work. Our goal is to provide a collaborative environment where intellectual curiosity and the pursuit of applied knowledge thrive. Insight Hatch explores the intersections of applied mathematics, engineering disciplines, and computer science, uniting diverse thinkers in a shared mission.

Key tenets of Insight Hatch include:
- **Inclusivity and Diversity**: We believe in the power of varied minds working towards a common goal.
- **Open Source Principles**: All works are released under the GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL) to ensure accessibility.
- **Long-Term Focus**: We aim for incremental progress with the hope of reaching transformative insights.
