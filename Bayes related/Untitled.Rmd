## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Deriving the Rules of Probability

To derive the rules of probability, consider the general case involving two random variables $(X)$ and $(Y)$.

### Example Context
In a medical example:
- $(X)$ could represent the **presence or absence of cancer**.
- $(Y)$ could represent the **outcome of a diagnostic test**.

These variables vary between individuals in generally unknown ways, so they are referred to as **random variables** (or **stochastic variables**).

### Variable Definitions
We assume:

- $(X)$ can take values $(x_i)$, where $i = 1, \ldots, L$,
- $(Y)$ can take values $(y_j)$, where $j = 1, \ldots, M$.

### Observational Setup
Suppose there are $N$ total trials in which we sample both $(X)$ and $(Y)$. Define:

- $(n_{ij})$: the **number of trials** where $(X = x_i)$ and $(Y = y_j)$,
- $(c_i)$: the **number of trials** where $(X = x_i)$ (irrespective of $(Y)$),
- $(r_j)$: the **number of trials** where $(Y = y_j)$ (irrespective of $(X)$).

### Joint Probability
The **joint probability** $p(X = x_i, Y = y_j)$ is the probability that:

- $(X)$ takes the value $(x_i)$,
- and $(Y)$ takes the value $(y_j)$.

It is calculated as the fraction of trials $(n_{ij})$, where $(X = x_i)$ and $(Y = y_j)$, divided by the total number of trials $(N)$:
$$
p(X = x_i, Y = y_j) = \frac{n_{ij}}{N}.
$$

This represents the proportion of observations falling into the corresponding cell $(i, j)$ in a contingency table.
